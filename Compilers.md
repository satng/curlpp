cURLpp is meant to be portable, but I can't maintain, all by myself, a project file for every platform that exists. Here's the environnements that I maintain, or will maintain personally:

  * Max OS X/GCC 2.95/GCC 3.x/GCC 4.x
  * Linux/GCC 2.95/GCC 3.x/GCC 4.x
  * Cygwin/GCC 2.95/GCC 3.x/GCC 4.x

I know there's some people who wants a VC++ project file. I don't want to maintain those VC++ files. I don't want to because I don't have any licence of VC++ and I don't want to buy one. The only way I will make available some Win32 binaries(DLL), is with MinGW. However, if someone is willing to maintain thoses files, it will be my pleasure to make them available.
